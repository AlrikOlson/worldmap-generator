# Wasteland Game

## Overview
Wasteland Game is a 2D procedurally generated survival game built using Pygame and Python. The player must navigate a post-apocalyptic wasteland, scavenging for resources, crafting items, and fighting off hostile creatures to survive. The game features a fully procedurally generated world, including graphics, sound effects, and music, with minimal pre-made assets.

## Game Features
1. Fully procedurally generated wasteland map, including terrain, resources, and structures
2. Procedurally generated player character and hostile creatures
3. Procedural item and resource generation for scavenging and crafting
4. Procedurally generated sound effects and music
5. Dynamic hunger, thirst, and health management based on procedural factors
6. Procedural day/night cycle affecting visibility and creature behavior
7. Procedurally generated shelter layouts and upgrades

## Gameplay
### Map Generation
- The game world is entirely procedurally generated using a combination of Perlin noise, cellular automata, and other algorithms.
- Terrain features, resources, and structures are generated based on procedural rules and constraints.
- The map ensures a balanced distribution of resources and challenges, with each playthrough offering a unique experience.

### Player Character
- The player character's appearance is procedurally generated, including body type, clothing, and accessories.
- Character attributes such as health, hunger, and thirst are initialized based on procedural factors.
- The player's starting inventory and skills are also determined procedurally.

### Resource Scavenging and Inventory
- Resources are procedurally generated and distributed throughout the wasteland based on the terrain and biome.
- The properties and characteristics of resources, such as scarcity and usefulness, are determined procedurally.
- The player's inventory size and management constraints are generated based on procedural rules.

### Crafting System
- Crafting recipes are procedurally generated, determining the required resources and resulting items.
- The properties and effectiveness of crafted items are determined through procedural algorithms.
- Crafting stations and their upgrades are procedurally generated based on the player's progress and resources.

### Hostile Creatures
- The appearance, attributes, and behaviors of hostile creatures are procedurally generated.
- Creature spawning, patrolling, and combat patterns are determined through procedural algorithms.
- The difficulty and variety of creatures encountered are adjusted procedurally based on the player's progress.

### Hunger, Thirst, and Health Management
- The rates of hunger, thirst, and health depletion are procedurally determined based on the player's actions and environment.
- The effects of consuming procedurally generated food and water items are calculated dynamically.
- Sickness and other status effects are procedurally generated based on the player's choices and environment.

### Day/Night Cycle
- The length, intensity, and color of the day/night cycle are procedurally generated.
- The effects of the day/night cycle on visibility, creature behavior, and resource availability are determined procedurally.
- Dynamic weather patterns and their impact on gameplay are generated procedurally.

### Shelter Building
- The layouts, sizes, and upgrade paths of shelters are procedurally generated based on the player's resources and progress.
- The effectiveness and durability of shelters are determined through procedural algorithms.
- The resources required for building and upgrading shelters are procedurally adjusted based on the player's situation.

## Art Style and Assets
- The game's art style is achieved through procedural generation of textures, sprites, and animations.
- Procedural algorithms are used to generate coherent and visually appealing assets that match the post-apocalyptic theme.
- Color palettes, shading, and other visual effects are dynamically generated to create a consistent and immersive atmosphere.

## Sound and Music
- Sound effects for player actions, creature noises, and environmental ambience are procedurally generated.
- The game's soundtrack is procedurally composed, adapting to the player's actions and progress.
- Procedural variations in sound effects and music ensure a dynamic and immersive audio experience.

## User Interface
- The layout and design of the user interface are procedurally generated to match the game's art style and theme.
- UI elements, such as icons and text, are dynamically generated based on the player's inventory, stats, and progress.
- Tutorial messages and tooltips are procedurally generated to provide context-sensitive guidance to the player.

## Technical Requirements
- The game is developed using Python 3.x and Pygame library, with a focus on procedural generation techniques.
- The game should run on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.
- The game should support keyboard input and have configurable controls.
- The game should have a minimum resolution of 1280x720 pixels and support fullscreen mode.

## Stretch Goals
- Procedurally generated quests and events to provide additional challenges and rewards.
- Procedurally generated faction system with dynamic relationships and interactions.
- Procedural skill tree and character progression system for player customization and specialization.
- Procedurally generated multiplayer mode for cooperative or competitive gameplay.

## Development Roadmap
1. Set up the project structure and dependencies, focusing on procedural generation libraries and techniques.
2. Develop the procedural map generation system, including terrain, resources, and structures.
3. Implement the procedural player character generation and basic movement controls.
4. Create the procedural resource scavenging and inventory management systems.
5. Develop the procedural crafting system and related UI elements.
6. Implement the procedural generation of hostile creatures and their AI behaviors.
7. Create the procedural hunger, thirst, and health management systems.
8. Implement the procedural day/night cycle and its effects on gameplay.
9. Develop the procedural shelter building and upgrade mechanics.
10. Refine the procedural generation of art assets, sound effects, and music.
11. Optimize performance, fix bugs, and balance the procedurally generated gameplay elements.
12. Conduct playtesting and gather feedback for further improvements and fine-tuning of the procedural systems.

By embracing procedural generation in every aspect of the game, from the world and characters to the items, sound, and visuals, Wasteland Game aims to provide a truly unique and replayable survival experience. The focus on procedural techniques allows for a vast and ever-changing game world that challenges players to adapt and overcome the generated obstacles. The minimal use of pre-made assets ensures that each playthrough feels fresh and unpredictable, offering endless possibilities for exploration and survival in the procedurally generated wasteland.
