# üåç Procedural World Generator

## Overview

This project is a procedural world generator built using Python and Pygame, with heavy utilization of libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and PyTorch. The application generates procedural worlds with labeled continents rendered with various terrain types such as deep water, shallow water, grasslands, forests, mountains, and snow.

## Features

- Procedural generation of world maps using Perlin noise.
- Rendering using Pygame.
- Ability to label and highlight continents.

## Roadmap

- Better approximation for geological processes in terrain generation.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- üêç Python 3.7+
- üì¶ PIP (Python package installer)

### Steps

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AlrikOlson/worldmap-generator

# Navigate to the project directory
cd worldmap-generator

# Install the required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Using Command Line

Simply run the main script to start the procedural world generator.

```sh
python src/main.py
```

### Using VS Code

1. **Open the Project**: Open the project folder in VS Code.

2. **Install Extensions**:
   - Install the Python extension for VS Code.
  
3. **Run the Project**:
   - Open the Run and Debug side panel (using the play icon on the sidebar or `Ctrl+Shift+D`).
   - Select the configuration "Python: Debug Map Generator".
   - Click the green play button or press `F5` to start debugging.

### Controls

- **üîÑ Spacebar**: Generate a new random world.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several packages:

- **core**: Contains the primary logic for the game, world generation, rendering, and continent labeling.
- **procedural**: Contains modules for generating procedural terrain using Perlin noise, and applying geological and erosion processes.
- **ui**: Contains UI components like buttons.
- **utils**: Contains utility classes for device management, random seed management, and progress updates.

## Dependencies

- `pygame`: For rendering and window management.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `torch`: For computational operations (supports CUDA and MPS).
- `scipy`: For labeling contiguous regions (used in continent labeling).

Install all dependencies using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Customization

### Adjusting Map Generation Parameters

You can customize various parameters in the procedural generation logic:

- **scale**: Affects the zoom level of the noise map.
- **octaves**: Controls the number of layers of Perlin noise.
- **persistence** and **lacunarity**: Modify the amplitude and frequency of octaves.
- **erosion settings**: Located in the erosion and geological modules.

### üé® Changing Colors

To adjust the colors of different terrain types, modify the color constants in the world renderer.
